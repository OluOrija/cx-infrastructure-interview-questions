Given an example like say we have diffenrent aws accounts representing diffenrent environments i.e
AcctA - Integration, AcctB - UAT, AcctC - Production
In keeping with aws best practices of the five pillars, High Availability and Security spring to mind when thinking about deployments.
At the least we want our deployments secure and without disrupting operations.

There are various deployment methods used in the industry today:
Blue/Green
Canary
...etc
The common requirment for all deployments is the artefact to be deployed.
As illiustrated in the diagram, S3 becomes important in how we handle/deliver the artefact.
Along with S3 is a need for immutable infrastructure as code.

Scenario - Using autoscaling group
In this scenario each deployable service in the application runs off an autoscaling group
ASG's are essentially definitions for groups of ec2 instances performing thesame functions 
and backed by launch configs that specify how these ec2 instances should launch.
These ec2 instances then launch from a prepared AMI that delivers an instance ready to perform the role/function within that application stack.
Coupled with the AMI is the ability for ec2 instances to run a userdata script.
Userdata Script is ran just after the machine is instantiated.
Within the user data is where the magic of deployment happens.
    The artefact is retrived from S3
    Uzipped into correct file system path
    Finish application configuration via user data script.
